# Progress

## February 5

Today we:

* went over the usual - things like the syllabus
* we began installing software and *amazingly* Microsoft introduced a bug into the Bing search engine which, apparently, runs more stuff that expected. This cost us a lot of time.

## February 7

On this day:

* I believe all students are ready to begin learning to code as all software seems to be installed.
* you were advised of the existance of reading assignment 1 - to read Chapter 1 of zybooks. The work is due just before midnight on **Monday** which means at class on Monday, you can ask questions to help you maximize your score.
