# Progress

## February 5

Today we:

* went over the usual - things like the syllabus
* we began installing software and *amazingly* Microsoft introduced a bug into the Bing search engine which, apparently, runs more stuff that expected. This cost us a lot of time.

## February 7

On this day:

* I believe all students are ready to begin learning to code as all software seems to be installed.
* you were advised of the existance of reading assignment 1 - to read Chapter 1 of zybooks. The work is due just before midnight on **Monday** which means at class on Monday, you can ask questions to help you maximize your score.

## February 10

Today we used Python interactively. We learned:

* how to exit Python using `^Z return` on Windows and `^D` on the Mac. Or, on both platforms you can type `exit()` and hit return.
* about variables and assignment
* about expressions (things that get evaluated)
* operators like +, -, / and *
* an order of precedence exists between the math operators which can be altered by parenthesis
* `[` and `]` are called brackets
* `{` and `}` are called braces
* `(` and `)` are called the usual parenthesis
* when interactive Python surrounds output with single quotes, it represents a string
* when interactive Python surrounds output with brackets, it indicates a list
* variable names can include upper and lower case letters, numbers and underscores - numbers cannot be first
* variable names are case sensitive
* `=` is the assignment operator - what is to the right is evaluated and assigned to the variable on the left
* `==` tests for equality which results in `True` or `False`
* floating point numbers are approximations
* a teeny bit about printing
* what functions are
* what arguments are

We also went over some problems from chapter 1.

## February 12

We reviewed and took a quiz.

We will:
* write a program launching it from VS Code
* study the if statement
