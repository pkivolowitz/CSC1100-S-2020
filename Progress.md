# Progress

## February 5

Today we:

* went over the usual - things like the syllabus
* we began installing software and *amazingly* Microsoft introduced a bug into the Bing search engine which, apparently, runs more stuff that expected. This cost us a lot of time.

## February 7

On this day:

* I believe all students are ready to begin learning to code as all software seems to be installed.
* you were advised of the existance of reading assignment 1 - to read Chapter 1 of zybooks. The work is due just before midnight on **Monday** which means at class on Monday, you can ask questions to help you maximize your score.

## February 10

Today we used Python interactively. We learned:

* how to exit Python using `^Z return` on Windows and `^D` on the Mac. Or, on both platforms you can type `exit()` and hit return.
* about variables and assignment
* about expressions (things that get evaluated)
* operators like +, -, / and *
* an order of precedence exists between the math operators which can be altered by parenthesis
* `[` and `]` are called brackets
* `{` and `}` are called braces
* `(` and `)` are called the usual parenthesis
* when interactive Python surrounds output with single quotes, it represents a string
* when interactive Python surrounds output with brackets, it indicates a list
* variable names can include upper and lower case letters, numbers and underscores - numbers cannot be first
* variable names are case sensitive
* `=` is the assignment operator - what is to the right is evaluated and assigned to the variable on the left
* `==` tests for equality which results in `True` or `False`
* floating point numbers are approximations
* a teeny bit about printing
* what functions are
* what arguments are

We also went over some problems from chapter 1.

## February 12

We reviewed but deferred the quiz to Friday.

We:
* learned a bunch about VS Code
* wrote a program and launched it from VS Code
* studied the if statement
  * if
  * if / else
  * if / elif / else
* learned about the importance of comments
* learned about the importance of indentation
* saw a video about plate spinning and related it to commenting

## February 14

Today we dined on filet mignon prepared in the French style, lobster tails and drank Chiante Classico from the vinyard of Giovanni da Varrazzano. No. Wait. That was my wife and me.

What we did in class is:

* we took the Chapter 1 quiz
* we reviewed `if` statements and its cousins
* we worked on the `ages` program to practice if statements

65 minute classes seem to short when there's so much fun to be had!
