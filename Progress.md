# Progress

## February 5

Today we:

* went over the usual - things like the syllabus
* we began installing software and *amazingly* Microsoft introduced a bug into the Bing search engine which, apparently, runs more stuff that expected. This cost us a lot of time.

## February 7

On this day I hope to assign the first reading and also finish installation. Maybe some Interactive Python too.
