## Introduction to Computing

The point of this course is simply this:

<center><i>At the end of this course, you should be able to do something useful in your own major.</i></center>

We will be using the Python programming language. Python is extremely powerful - super powerful in fact - yet easy to use. Specifically, we will be using Python 3.7X. Installing all the right software is time consuming and instructions must be followed exactly.

### What does *something useful* mean?

A large part of this course will relate to the processing of data. Perhaps some data format conversion, perhaps some analysis. Maybe some charting. The data, of course, can come from your own major later in your college career and off into your professional career. Think about what data from your major you can work on in class projects.

If not data, maybe there is a task in your major that can be automated. Think about that too.

## Your laptop

The relative power of your laptop will *directly* bear upon your ability to do class work on your own device. It may very well be that you will need to use a classroom computer rather than your own device.

* You will need at least 6 gigabytes of space available on your disk.
* Your will work best with at least 8 gigabytes of memory. Four is somewhat workable but painful.
* **It is critical that your operating system must be current**

A nearly current Windows 10 is required or MacOS 10 is required. MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) is preferred but not required.

While the needs of this course are modest, I cannot compensate for a laptop that is insufficient. All that I can offer is that the desktop computers in the classroom have all the needed software already installed. During class time, it may be necessary that you use these desktop computers. 

Note that these computers **Do not offer permanent storage**. This means you must either:

* Make religious use of cloud storage (such as Google Drive) or,
* Make religious use of a USB drive.

"Religious use" means that prior to beginning work every day, you must ensure your latest work is downloaded or copied onto the desktop computer. It also means that after completing work, you must upload or save your work from the desktop computer.

**Again, any files left on these computers are deleted overnight. Work not saved on a cloud storage service or USB drive will be lost.**

If you do not have a desktop computer at home, all you have access to will be these in-class computers. Unfortunately, this would mean that all classwork would necessarily have to be done in this room.
 
### Installation equates to (my) frustration

The planets must align perfectly for installation to procede easily for the **entire** class. I have spent many hours assembling the right software and documenting installation practices. It is critical you succeed in all instructed tasks.

Remember that:

* You will all be trying to download large amounts at the same time over the same WiFi network. Downloading will be *slow*.
* You have different OS's with different versions of each installed. For an instructor, this is a **nightmare**. I assure you I, at least, **will** become frustrated and **will** swear like a sailor. The f-bomb is one of my basic food groups. *My frustration will be with <u>me</u> and <u>my</u> feelings of helplessness in trying to make things perfect for you*. Again, if I become frustrated during installing software on your laptops, it isn't you!  
* You have laptops of varying capability. See previous re: **nightmare**.

The important thing is this: I carry the weight of responsibility for the entire class and I want things to be perfect - so yeah, I will get frustrated. What I ask of you as individuals is to be patient and tolerant. We'll get it right (which may mean you'll need to use a classroom computer).

### Cost of  required software

$0.00.

### If you are buying a new laptop

* Do not get an AMD-based laptop - AMD CPU's *are* less expensive *but* they perform worse than Intel CPU's in many cases.
* Get a minimum of a dual core Core i5. Preferred is a quad core Core i5 or i7 (best is any Core i9).
* Go no older than "8th generation". "9th generation" or later is preferred.
* Get a minimum of 8 GB of RAM. This is a hard minimum. More than 8 GB of RAM is better.
* Get an SSD - all current Mac laptops are SSD based. *DO NOT GET* a spinning disk drive. For both platforms, 256 GB of space is probably a safe minimum.

This link shows that it is possible to get a decent laptop for around 500 to 600 dollars. Laptops in 700 to 900 dollar range will likely be quite fine - if you stick with the suggestions.

As for how much to spend for a Mac, the top-end Mac desktop all tricked out is about $58,000. Knock yourself out. If you can afford one of these, my son is single and as far as I know, straight, if that makes a difference.

## Text Book

Our textbook is found online. You must subscribe to it - it is not free (though it is far less than a traditional textbook):

1. Sign in or create an account at learn.zybooks.com
2. Enter zyBook code: CARTHAGECSC1100KivolowitzSpring2020
3. Subscribe

Ensure that you use your @carthage.edu email address.

## Absences

There is an attendence component to your grade. You get 1 free pass. After that, each additional absence is 2 percentage points off your aggregate final score up to 12 points. Students traveling for sporting or other events must supply official correspondence from a coach or other supervisor.

## Grading

Grades will be based upon the following (subject to change):

| Component | Weight |
| --------- | ------ |
| Readings | 60% |
| Quizzes | 28% |
| Attendance | 12% |

Readings will come from zybooks (the electronic book). Quiz questions will come from a test bank prepared by zybooks so will be closely tied to the readings.

| Lower Bound | Upper Bound | Letter Grade |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 90  | 100  | A |
| 87  | < 90  | A- |
| 83  | < 87  | B+ |
| 80  | < 83  | B |
| 77  | < 80 | B- |
| 73  | < 77  | C+ |
| 70  | < 73  | C |
| 60  | < 70 | D |
| 0  | < 60 | F |

Please note that the scale above may be changed at the instructor's discretion.

## Other

### A comment about equity and inclusion

I completely subscribe and agree with the Carthage statements on equity and inclusion. See them [here](https://www.carthage.edu/equity-inclusion/mission-statement/).

### Advising and accommodations

The Carthage Advising Center offers a variety of services and accommodations to students with disabilities, based on appropriate documentation, nature of disability, and academic need. In order to initiate services, students should meet with Diane Schowalter at the start of the semester to discuss reasonable accommodation. After meeting with Diane Schowalter, students in need of accommodations should also speak with individual faculty members from whom accommodations are sought to communicate their needs and make requests in a timely manner. If a student does not request accommodation or provide documentation, the faculty member is under no obligation to provide accommodations. You may contact Diane Schowalter at ext. 5802 or via e-mail at dschowalter1@carthage.edu.

### A note about accessibility

Carthage College strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers due to your disability (including mental health, learning disorders and chronic medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options.  To establish reasonable accommodations, you also need to register with Diane Schowalter in Learning Accessibility Services (dschowalter1@carthage.edu).

### Academic Success and Health

Good health can help you achieve academic success. The Health and Counseling Center (HCC) supports students by addressing physical, mental, and emotional well-being. All services are free and confidential and are provided by experienced and licensed professionals. Services are available to all full-time, undergraduate students.

### Possibility of changes made to the course

Please note the above schedule, policies, procedures and assignments in the course are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement and / or to encourage better student outcomes.

### Concerning learning outcomes

Students may vary in their competency levels of any stated outcome. Students can expect to achieve stated outcomes only if they honor all course policies, attend classes regularly, complete all assigned work in good faith and on time and meet all other course expectations of them as students.
